# Test Challenge

I have received the proposal of a test by **Shawn And Partners**,  <br>
to create a client and server implementation of the **Github API**, to show the users and repositories. <br>

I have chosen to implement the Backend in *Node.js*, although not my strongest Backend technology, it is indeed one of most popular out there!

And for the Frontend, I decided to implement in *Angular* (2+), since it is my strongest <br>
Frontend technology.
